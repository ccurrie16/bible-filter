**BIBLE FILTER**

This is a tool that helps you clean up massive Bible files by using a "smart filter" to pick out the best verses for your needs. Instead of manually deleting thousands of lines about ancient measurements or long lists of names, you can let Ollama do the heavy lifting for you. To get started, you just need to:

- Make sure you have Python and Ollama on your computer.

- Open your terminal and type ollama pull llama3.2.

- Open your project folder in the terminal, type pip install -r requirements.txt followed by python main.py, and answer the questions on your screen to start filtering.
